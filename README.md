### Running Unit Test in XCode

Now that you have the unit test target in your project, you can run the tests from the menu bar with Product > Test or just use the keyboard shortcut:⌘U

When the tests finish, you should see green checkmarks in the Test Navigator in the left pane (⌘6) indicating that the tests passed.
